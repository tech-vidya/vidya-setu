## What is Algebra?
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. It helps us solve problems where some information is unknown.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Variables**: Letters (x, y, z) that represent unknown values
2. **Constants**: Fixed numbers (5, -3, 0.5)
3. **Expressions**: Combinations of variables and constants (3x + 5)
4. **Equations**: Mathematical statements showing equality (2x + 3 = 11)

## Basic Operations:
- **Addition**: 3x + 2x = 5x
- **Subtraction**: 5y - 2y = 3y
- **Multiplication**: 3 × 4x = 12x
- **Division**: 15x ÷ 3 = 5x

## Example Problems:
1. Simplify: 4a + 3a - 2a = 5a
2. Solve: x + 7 = 15 → x = 8
3. Expand: 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6

## Real-Life Applications:
- Calculating shopping discounts
- Planning budgets
- Measuring distances and speeds`,

## Definition
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, in the form:
**ax² + bx + c = 0** where a ≠ 0

## Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations:

### 1. Factoring Method
Example: x² - 5x + 6 = 0
- Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
- Solutions: x = 2 or x = 3

### 2. Quadratic Formula
**x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a**

Example: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0
- a = 2, b = 5, c = -3
- x = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4
- x = (-5 ± 7) / 4
- x = 0.5 or x = -3

### 3. Completing the Square
Example: x² + 6x + 5 = 0
- x² + 6x = -5
- x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9
- (x + 3)² = 4
- x + 3 = ±2
- x = -1 or x = -5

## The Discriminant (Δ)
Δ = b² - 4ac tells us about roots:
- Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots
- Δ = 0: One repeated root
- Δ < 0: No real roots (complex roots)

## Applications:
- Projectile motion in physics
- Area and optimization problems
- Business profit calculations
- Engineering design`,

## Introduction
Trigonometry is the study of relationships between angles and sides of triangles.

## Basic Trigonometric Ratios (SOH-CAH-TOA):
For a right-angled triangle:
- **sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse**
- **cos θ = Adjacent / Hypotenuse**
- **tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent**

## Reciprocal Functions:
- cosec θ = 1/sin θ
- sec θ = 1/cos θ
- cot θ = 1/tan θ

## Standard Angles:
| Angle | 0° | 30° | 45° | 60° | 90° |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| sin | 0 | 1/2 | 1/√2 | √3/2 | 1 |
| cos | 1 | √3/2 | 1/√2 | 1/2 | 0 |
| tan | 0 | 1/√3 | 1 | √3 | ∞ |

## Important Identities:
1. sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
2. 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
3. 1 + cot²θ = cosec²θ

## Definition
An Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

Example: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14... (common difference d = 3)

## Key Formulas:

### 1. nth Term
**aₙ = a + (n-1)d**
- a = first term
- d = common difference
- n = term number

Example: Find 10th term of 3, 7, 11, 15...
- a = 3, d = 4
- a₁₀ = 3 + (10-1)×4 = 3 + 36 = 39

### 2. Sum of n Terms
**Sₙ = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]**
or
**Sₙ = n/2[a + l]** where l is the last term

Example: Sum of first 20 terms of 5, 10, 15, 20...
- a = 5, d = 5, n = 20
- S₂₀ = 20/2[2×5 + (20-1)×5]
- S₂₀ = 10[10 + 95] = 1050

## Practice Problems:
1. Is 301 a term in AP: 5, 11, 17, 23...?
2. Find sum: 7 + 13 + 19 + ... + 205
3. How many terms of AP: 9, 17, 25... sum to 636?

        textContent: `# Photosynthesis - The Life Process

## Definition
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize food (glucose) from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

## Chemical Equation:
**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**

## Site of Photosynthesis:
- **Organelle**: Chloroplast
- **Pigment**: Chlorophyll (green pigment)
- **Location**: Mainly in leaves

## Two Stages:

### 1. Light Reaction (Light-dependent)
- **Where**: Thylakoid membranes of chloroplast
- **Requirements**: Light, water, chlorophyll
- **Products**: ATP, NADPH, O₂
- Water is split: 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + O₂

### 2. Dark Reaction (Calvin Cycle)
- **Where**: Stroma of chloroplast
- **Requirements**: CO₂, ATP, NADPH
- **Products**: Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)
- Can occur in light or dark

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
1. **Light Intensity**: More light = faster rate (up to saturation point)
2. **CO₂ Concentration**: Higher CO₂ = increased rate
3. **Temperature**: Optimal at 25-35°C
4. **Water**: Essential reactant
5. **Chlorophyll**: More chlorophyll = better efficiency

## Importance:
- Produces oxygen for all living beings
- Food source for entire food chain
- Removes CO₂ from atmosphere
- Maintains ecological balance

## Experiments:
1. **Starch test**: Proves light is necessary
2. **Destarching**: Shows chlorophyll is essential
3. **Oxygen evolution**: Demonstrates O₂ production`,

        textContent: `# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law (Law of Inertia)
**"An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force."**

### Examples:
- Passengers jerk forward when bus suddenly stops
- A ball keeps rolling on smooth surface
- Seat belts protect during sudden stops

### Inertia:
- Tendency of objects to resist change in motion
- Depends on mass (heavier = more inertia)

## Second Law (F = ma)
**"Force equals mass times acceleration"**
**F = ma**

### Key Points:
- Force is proportional to acceleration
- Direction of force = direction of acceleration
- SI Unit: Newton (N) = kg⋅m/s²

### Examples:
1. Pushing a car (heavy mass needs more force)
2. Cricket ball acceleration when hit
3. Rocket propulsion

### Problems:
- A 5 kg object accelerates at 2 m/s²
- Force = 5 × 2 = 10 N

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)
**"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"**

### Important:
- Forces always occur in pairs
- Act on different objects
- Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction

### Examples:
1. Walking: Foot pushes ground backward, ground pushes foot forward
2. Swimming: Hands push water backward, water pushes body forward
3. Rocket launch: Gas expelled downward, rocket pushed upward
4. Jumping: Legs push ground down, ground pushes body up

## Applications:
- Vehicle safety systems
- Sports biomechanics
- Space exploration
- Engineering design

## Practice Problems:
1. Calculate force on 10kg object with acceleration 5m/s²
2. Why do we fall forward when bus brakes suddenly?
3. Explain how rockets work using third law`,

## Indicators of Chemical Reaction:
1. Change in color
2. Evolution of gas
3. Formation of precipitate
4. Change in temperature
5. Change in state

## Chemical Equation:
**Reactants → Products**

Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

## Balancing Chemical Equations:
**Law of Conservation of Mass**: Mass is neither created nor destroyed

### Steps:
1. Count atoms on both sides
2. Add coefficients to balance
3. Verify all atoms are balanced

### Example:
Unbalanced: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃
Balanced: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

## Types of Chemical Reactions:

### 1. Combination Reaction
Two or more substances combine to form one product
- **C + O₂ → CO₂**
- **CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂**

### 2. Decomposition Reaction
One substance breaks into two or more products
- **2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂** (electrolysis)
- **CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂** (thermal decomposition)

### 3. Displacement Reaction
More reactive element displaces less reactive one
- **Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu**
- **Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu**

### 4. Double Displacement Reaction
Exchange of ions between two compounds
- **NaCl + AgNO₃ → AgCl + NaNO₃**
- **Na₂SO₄ + BaCl₂ → BaSO₄ + 2NaCl**

### 5. Redox Reactions
Simultaneous oxidation and reduction
- **CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O**
  (CuO reduced, H₂ oxidized)

## Oxidation and Reduction:
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons/gain of oxygen
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons/loss of oxygen

## Applications:
- Cooking food
- Rusting of iron
- Digestion in body
- Battery operation
- Photography`,

## Electric Current
**Definition**: Flow of electric charge through a conductor

### Formula:
**I = Q/t**
- I = Current (Ampere, A)
- Q = Charge (Coulomb, C)
- t = Time (seconds, s)

### Direction:
- Conventional current: Positive to negative
- Electron flow: Negative to positive

## Electric Potential & Voltage
**Potential Difference (V)**: Work done to move unit charge
**V = W/Q**
- V = Voltage (Volt, V)
- W = Work (Joule, J)
- Q = Charge (Coulomb, C)

## Ohm's Law
**"Current through conductor is directly proportional to voltage across it"**

### Formula:
**V = IR**
- V = Voltage (V)
- I = Current (A)
- R = Resistance (Ω)

### Example:
If V = 12V and R = 4Ω, then:
I = V/R = 12/4 = 3A

## Resistance
**Opposition to flow of current**

### Factors Affecting Resistance:
1. **Length (l)**: R ∝ l (longer = more resistance)
2. **Area (A)**: R ∝ 1/A (thicker = less resistance)
3. **Material**: Different resistivity (ρ)
4. **Temperature**: Higher temp = more resistance

### Formula:
**R = ρl/A**

## Series and Parallel Circuits:

### Series Circuit:
- **Current**: Same through all (I₁ = I₂ = I₃)
- **Voltage**: Divides (V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃)
- **Resistance**: R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

### Parallel Circuit:
- **Current**: Divides (I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃)
- **Voltage**: Same across all (V₁ = V₂ = V₃)
- **Resistance**: 1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

## Electric Power
**Rate of doing work or consuming energy**

### Formulas:
- **P = VI** (Power = Voltage × Current)
- **P = I²R** (using Ohm's law)
- **P = V²/R**
- Unit: Watt (W) or Joule/second

## Electric Energy
**E = P × t = VIt**
- Commercial unit: kWh (kilowatt-hour)
- 1 kWh = 1000W × 3600s = 3.6 × 10⁶ J

### Example:
100W bulb for 10 hours:
Energy = 100W × 10h = 1000Wh = 1 kWh = 1 Unit

## Heating Effect of Current
**H = I²Rt** (Joule's Law)
- Heat produced in conductor
- Used in: Heaters, irons, bulbs, fuses

## Practical Applications:
1. **Household wiring**: Parallel connection
2. **Fuse**: Protects from overloading
3. **MCB**: Modern circuit breaker
4. **Earthing**: Safety measure

## Important Points:
- Voltmeter: Connected in parallel (high resistance)
- Ammeter: Connected in series (low resistance)
- Good conductors: Copper, aluminum, silver
- Insulators: Rubber, plastic, wood`,

age = 15                # Integer
height = 5.6            # Float
is_student = True       # Boolean

# Print output
print("Hello, World!")
print("My name is", name)
\`\`\`

#### 2. Data Types

**Numeric Types:**
- **int**: Whole numbers (5, -10, 1000)
- **float**: Decimal numbers (3.14, -0.5)
- **complex**: Complex numbers (3+4j)

**Sequence Types:**
- **str**: Strings ("Hello")
- **list**: [1, 2, 3, "four"]
- **tuple**: (1, 2, 3) - immutable

**Other Types:**
- **bool**: True/False
- **dict**: {"name": "Aarav", "age": 15}
- **set**: {1, 2, 3} - unique elements

### 3. Operators

#### Arithmetic:
\`\`\`python
a, b = 10, 3
print(a + b)    # Addition: 13
print(a - b)    # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)    # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)    # Division: 3.333...
print(a // b)   # Floor division: 3
print(a % b)    # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b)   # Power: 1000
\`\`\`

#### Comparison:
\`\`\`python
print(10 == 10)   # Equal: True
print(10 != 5)    # Not equal: True
print(10 > 5)     # Greater than: True
print(10 <= 15)   # Less than or equal: True
\`\`\`

#### Logical:
\`\`\`python
print(True and False)  # False
print(True or False)   # True
print(not True)        # False
\`\`\`

## Control Structures

### 1. If-Else Statements

\`\`\`python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")
\`\`\`

### 2. Loops

#### For Loop:
\`\`\`python
# Loop through range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Loop through list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop through string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
\`\`\`

#### While Loop:
\`\`\`python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
\`\`\`

### 3. Break and Continue

\`\`\`python
# Break: Exit loop
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)  # Prints 0-4

# Continue: Skip iteration
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)  # Prints 0,1,3,4
\`\`\`

## Functions

### Defining Functions:

\`\`\`python
def greet(name):
    """Function to greet person"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call function
message = greet("Aarav")
print(message)  # Hello, Aarav!

# Function with default parameter
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(5))      # 25 (5²)
print(power(5, 3))   # 125 (5³)
\`\`\`

## Lists and List Operations

\`\`\`python
# Create list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, True]

# Access elements
print(numbers[0])    # 1 (first)
print(numbers[-1])   # 5 (last)
print(numbers[1:3])  # [2, 3] (slice)

# Modify list
numbers.append(6)         # Add to end
numbers.insert(0, 0)      # Insert at position
numbers.remove(3)         # Remove value
numbers.pop()             # Remove last
numbers.sort()            # Sort list
numbers.reverse()         # Reverse list

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
\`\`\`

## Strings

\`\`\`python
text = "Python Programming"

# String methods
print(text.upper())         # PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(text.lower())         # python programming
print(text.split())         # ['Python', 'Programming']
print(text.replace("P", "J"))  # Jython Jrogramming
print(len(text))            # 18
print("Python" in text)     # True

# String formatting
name = "Aarav"
age = 15
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age}")
\`\`\`

## Dictionary

\`\`\`python
# Create dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Aarav",
    "age": 15,
    "grade": "10th",
    "subjects": ["Math", "Science"]
}

# Access values
print(student["name"])       # Aarav
print(student.get("age"))    # 15

# Modify dictionary
student["age"] = 16          # Update
student["school"] = "DPS"    # Add new
del student["grade"]         # Remove

# Loop through dictionary
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
\`\`\`

## Input and Output

\`\`\`python
# Input from user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Output
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old")

# File operations
# Write to file
with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Read from file
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
\`\`\`

## Practice Programs

### 1. Check Even/Odd:
\`\`\`python
num = int(input("Enter number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
\`\`\`

### 2. Factorial:
\`\`\`python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # 120
\`\`\`

### 3. Fibonacci Series:
\`\`\`python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b

fibonacci(10)  # 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
\`\`\`

## Best Practices:
1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Add comments for clarity
